** Kneuron Extension **

Description:

This is a Chrome/Edge extension that has been developed by Normand Defayette at Cortex R&D Inc. 

Its purpose is to fix shortcomings and add new features to the Knack's Builder.


Features: 

- Removes those black pesky popups that keep blocking our view in Knack's Builder when we hover over view and fields.
- Adds support for the Escape key to close dialogs and settings pages where a Cancel or X exists.


Setup:

On your workstation, unzip the file in a folder of your choice
In Chrome or Edge:
	go in Manage Extensions
	enable Developer mode
	click on Load unpacked and select the folder where the unzipped files are located
	
Refresh your Builder pages
Start working without frustration!

Enjoy,
Normand D.
